## FIRST Robotics Competition
* FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international robotics competition league for youth of any age
	* FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) and FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) for high school students
	* FLL (FIRST Lego League) and Jr. FLL for elementary and middle school students
* Every year students build a robot to compete with and against other teams
* This international competition is comprised of design and building challenges
* Students gain important skills in teamwork, strategy, science, engineering, and business
* Dedicated to spreading the word about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)
* Competitive but fun and friendly environment
* Gives participants a glimpse into the practical world by offering them a chance to learn real world skills
	* Engineering
	* Marketing
	* Leadership
	* Relationship goals [ed. note: #relationshipgoals...seriously though this needs to be more specific]
* Teams have to raise funds, recruit and lead themselves with minimal coach and mentor intervention

	* Marketing
	* Writing
	* Photography
	* Web design and development
	* Team support [ed. note: should this be more detailed?]
* We'll teach you everything you need to know

## Goals
* Become financially self-sustaining
* Build a competitive robot
* Expand outreach efforts promoting STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in the Greater Atlanta area
* Compete in the FIRST Championships in Saint Louis
* Impact more students
* Grow our team
* Become a positive force in our community

## Editor's notes
* Do we want to have a section on FLL?
	* Content dump: Community Outreach is an important part of FIRST and in the past, Toaster Tech has attended events to demonstrate its robot and spread the message of STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics). In 2015, the team sponsored a FLL team for LEAD, Noodle.  Ten students from 9-14 years of age will participate in the Trash Tek competition for their inaugural year.
