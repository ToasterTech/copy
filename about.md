## FIRST Robotics Competition

* Every year students build a robot to compete with and against other teams
* This international competition is comprised of design and building challenges
* Students gain important skills in teamwork, strategy, science, engineering, and business.

## The Team
* Comprised of students 13 to 18 years of age from diverse backgrounds
* Students from all over the Greater Atlanta Area can join
* Most of the team is home-schooled
* Other members are enrolled at public and private schools
* We aim to be inclusive on the field and off
* In particular we are looking for students with any of the following skills:
	* Mechanics
	* Design
	* Programming
	* Marketing
	* Writing
	* Photography
	* Web design and development
	* Team support [ed. note: should this be more detailed?]
* We'll teach you everything you need to know

## Goals
* Become financially self-sustaining
* Build a competitive robot
* Expand outreach efforts promoting STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in the Greater Atlanta area
* Compete in the FIRST Championships in Saint Louis
* Compete in two regional events
* Impact more students
* Grow our team
* Become a positive force in our community
* Actively pursue private and corporate sponsorship

## Sponsorship
* As a home school-based organization, we depend on funding from sponsors as well as grants and fundraising [ed. note: fundraising seems redundant]

	* Event registration is around $3,500 x 3 events per year
* Additional costs include food, transportation, and tooling

## Editor's notes
* Do we want to have a section on FLL?
	* Content dump: Community Outreach is an important part of FIRST and in the past, Toaster Tech has attended events to demonstrate its robot and spread the message of STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics). In 2015, the team sponsored a FLL team for LEAD, Noodle.  Ten students from 9-14 years of age will participate in the Trash Tek competition for their inaugural year.
