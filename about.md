#About

We are Toaster Tech, a FIRST Robotics Competition team 5332, located in Atlanta, Georgia and founded in 2013.

Toaster Tech is a 501(c)(3) non-profit robotics team hosted by LEADâ€™s (Learners and Educators of Atlanta and Decatur). We participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, where every year students build a robot to compete with and against other teams. This international competition is comprised of design and building challenges, where students gain important skills in teamwork, strategy, science and engineering, and business, where we strive to foster good relations. Our goals this year are to build a competitive robot, to expand our outreach efforts in promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in the Greater Atlanta area, and the ultimate goal of competing in the FIRST Championships in Saint Louis. Our intention is to participate in two regional events to impact more students by growing our team, and by becoming a positive force in our community. As a home school-based organization, Toaster Tech depends on the funding provided by sponsors. On average, parts cost around $4,000 per year, to register for an event is about $3,500, and with a possible total of 3 events including championships, $14,500 is an accurate annual cost with all added overall. Overhead costs include food, transportation, general tools. If you would like to become a sponsor, please email us at leadfrc@googlegroups.com or call 404.312.5506. â€” Matthew Gilchrist, senior member of Toaster Tech

Our regular meeting location is GA Tech Competition Center 14th St.

FIRST FRC Team was born out of a collaboration of the Georgia Tech Robojackets and LEAD to allow students who might not otherwise have access to a robotics team. Consequently, students from all over the Greater Atlanta Area can be a part of a yearly FIRST challenge. This year, the challenge is Stronghold.

Spreading technology like butter on Toast, LEAD's FRC team is in its third year and looking forward to the 2016 challenge announced on January 9th at Ga Tech. The team is comprised of students 13 to 18 years of age from diverse backgrounds. The team is especially proud of the involvement and accomplishments of our girls. Last year we had 5 girls on a team of 14 and received a substantial Women In Technology (WIT) grant. 
Funds for the season are raised through grants and sponsorship. For the last two years, Toaster Tech has been proudly sponsored by the Robojackets of GA Tech and is applying for sponsorship again this year.  Toaster Tech received a Rookie Grant in 2014 which has a residual through 2016.  Actively pursuing private and corporate sponsorship is one of our goals.  Fundraising should be active through the off season as time during build season is best spent in the shop. 

Though most of the team is homeschooled, there are team members enrolled at public and private schools as well.  Our aim is inclusivity on the field and off. The team is accepting new students interested in mechanics, design, programming, marketing, writing, photography, website maintenance and design and team support. For the last two years meetings during the season were held on 14th St at Ga Tech's competition center. At least one parent will be required to attend each meeting, these are divided up and the attending parent will provide a meal for the students and mentors. In addition our parents support the team in a variety of ways such as photography, organization, and general team support. 

Community Outreach is an important part of FIRST and in the past, Toaster Tech has attended events to demonstrate its robot and spread the message of STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics). In 2015, the team sponsored a FLL team for LEAD, Noodle.  Ten students from 9-14 years of age will participate in the Trash Tek competition for their inaugural year. 

The ultimate goal of the team is to become self sustaining. In 2014 and 2015 Toaster Tech has been fortunate to receive support from the Georgia Tech Robojackets.
