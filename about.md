## FIRST Robotics Competition

* Every year students build a robot to compete with and against other teams
* This international competition is comprised of design and building challenges
* Students gain important skills in teamwork, strategy, science, engineering, and business
* FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international robotics competition league for youth of any age
	* FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) and FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) for high school students
	* FLL (FIRST Lego League) and Jr. FLL for elementary and middle school students
* FIRST is dedicated to spreading the word about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)
* Competitive but fun and friendly environment
* Gives participants a glimpse into the practical world by offering them a chance to learn  real world skills
	* Engineering
	* Marketing
	* Leadership
	* Relationship goals [ed. note: #relationshipgoals...seriously though this needs to be more specific]
* Teams have to raise funds, recruit and lead themselves with minimal coach and mentor intervention
* Participants learn valuable real world skills

## Goals
* Become financially self-sustaining
* Build a competitive robot
* Expand outreach efforts promoting STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in the Greater Atlanta area

* Compete in two regional events
* Impact more students
* Grow our team
* Become a positive force in our community
* Actively pursue private and corporate sponsorship

## Sponsorship

	* Event registration is around $3,500 x 3 events per year
* Additional costs include food, transportation, and tooling
* To sponsor us:
	* Email leadfrc@googlegroups.com [ed. note: I would recommend an @toastertech.org email that goes to a parent who checks email frequently and can manage such communications]
	* Call (404) 312-5506

## Editor's notes
* Do we want to have a section on FLL?
	* Content dump: Community Outreach is an important part of FIRST and in the past, Toaster Tech has attended events to demonstrate its robot and spread the message of STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics). In 2015, the team sponsored a FLL team for LEAD, Noodle.  Ten students from 9-14 years of age will participate in the Trash Tek competition for their inaugural year.
